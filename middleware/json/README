\page MID_JSON json Middleware Library

\section Scope
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format. \n
It is easy for humans to read and write. \n
It is easy for machines to parse and generate. \n
It is based on a subset of the JavaScript Programming Language, \n
Standard ECMA-262 3rd Edition - December 1999. \n
JSON is a text format that is completely language independent but \n
uses conventions that are familiar to programmers of \n
the C-family of languages, including C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, Perl, Python, and many others. \n
These properties make JSON an ideal data-interchange language. \n
