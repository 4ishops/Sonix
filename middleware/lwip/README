\page LWIP Light Weight IP Library

\section Scope
lwIP is a small independent implementation of the TCP/IP protocol suite \n
that has been developed by Adam Dunkels at the Computer and Networks Architectures (CNA) lab \n
at the Swedish Institute of Computer Science (SICS).\n
The focus of the lwIP TCP/IP implementation is to reduce resource usage while still having a full scale TCP. \n
This making lwIP suitable for use in embedded systems \n
with tens of kilobytes of free RAM and room for around 40 kilobytes of code ROM.\n

\section Support Specification
1.IP (Internet Protocol) including packet forwarding over multiple network interfaces \n
2.ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) for network maintenance and debugging \n
3.IGMP (Internet Group Management Protocol) for multicast traffic management \n
4.UDP (User Datagram Protocol) including experimental UDP-lite extensions \n
5.TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) with congestion control, RTT estimation and fast recovery/fast retransmit \n
6.raw/native API for enhanced performance \n
7.Optional Berkeley-like socket API \n
8.DNS (Domain names resolver) \n
9.SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) \n
10.DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) \n
11.AUTOIP (for IPv4, conform with RFC 3927) \n
12.PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol) \n
13.ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) for Ethernet \n
